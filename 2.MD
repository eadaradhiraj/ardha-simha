# Andhra Socialist, 1921–71|एकविंशत्युत्तरनवशताधिकैकसहस्रतमात् वर्षात् एकसप्तत्युत्तरनवशताधिकैकसहस्रतमं वर्षम् पर्यन्तं आन्ध्रसमाजवादित्वम्

## Para 1

He was named after his grandfather, Narasimha Rao.|नरसिंहरावः स्वपितामहस्य नाम लब्धवान्।

Pamulaparti was the family name, and following Telugu convention, preceded his own.|पामुलपर्ति इति कुटुम्बनाम। तेलुगुप्रथानुसारं कुटुम्बनाम अग्रे दृश्यते। अनन्तरमेव निजनाम दृश्यते।

In between was god, Venkata, after the presiding deity of Tirupati.|मध्ये तु देवनाम तिरुपति-प्रभु-नाम वेङ्कटः।

A Sufi master knocked on the door of his father’s house soon after he was born. ‘Your son will become a baadshah.’ A king.|जन्मनः अचिरात् एव कश्चन सूफ़िपथिकः पितुः गृहद्वारम् ताडयित्वा कथितवान् यत् शिशुः राजा भविष्यति। 

## Para 2

Pamulaparti Venkata Narasimha Rao was born on 28 June 1921 in British India.|पामुलपर्ति-वेङ्कट-नरसिंह-रावः जून्-मासे अष्टविंशतितमे दिवसे एकविंशत्युतरनवशताधिकैकसहस्र-तमे वर्षे आङ्ग्ल-शासिते भारते लब्धजन्मा।

His family lived in Vangara, a settlement of rice fields in Karimnagar district, in what is now the state of Telangana.|तस्य कुटुम्बम् करीमनगर-स्थिते धान्यक्षेत्र-युक्ते अद्यतने तिलङ्गाना-राष्ट्रे वङ्गर-ग्रामे निवसितवन्तः।

As was custom, his pregnant mother travelled to her parents’ home in nearby Lakinepally to give birth.|प्रथानुसारं तस्य गर्भप्ररूढा माता अनतिदूरे लकिनेपल्ली-ग्रामे स्वमातापित्रोः गृहं प्रसवार्थं गतवती।

Both villages were in a part of India that was, in Rao’s telling, ‘geographically . . . a bridge between the North and the South’.|उभौ ग्रामौ भारतस्य तस्मिन् भूभगे स्थितौ यः नरसिंह-राव-कथनानुसारम् उत्तर-दक्षिणयोः मध्ये सेतुः आसीत्।

Living on the edge of five linguistic cultures, villagers here spoke Telugu, Hindi, Marathi, Kannada, and even some Oriya.|पञ्चस्य भाषाक्षेत्राणां सीमायां निवासिनः तेलुगुं, हिन्दीं, मराठीं, कन्नडम्, ओडीयां वक्तुम् अशक्नुवन्।

And in this the land of the Nizam, the language of power was Urdu, while the language of courtly life was Persian.|निजामस्य अस्यां भूमौ अधिकारस्य भाषा उर्दुः आसीत् सभाभाषा तु पारसभाषा।

Narasimha Rao would go on to speak ten languages.|अनन्तरं नरसिंहरावः दशं भाषाः वक्तुं समर्थः अभवत्

These were the tongues he inherited at birth.|जन्मनः एव देयरूपेण एताः भाषाः स्वीकृताः तेन।

His parents were of the Brahmin caste.|मातापितरौ ब्राह्मण-कुलसञ्जातौ।

Father Sitarama Rao owned 200 acres of dry land.|पिता सीताराम-रावः सम्पत्तौ द्विशतप्रहलपरिमिता भूमिः आसीत्।

The only other Brahmin family in the village was related to Narasimha’s family in three ways: by blood, a common wall, and a daily routine. This other family owned 1200 acres of rice fields and mango orchards, making them the largest landlords of the village—a fact that would matter to Narasimha, who would soon make this family his own.
